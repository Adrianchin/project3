# InceptionU Project 3 - Smart Glasses AI and ML Ecommerce Application

This is the final project for our InceptionU cohert 8 course taken in 2022. 

This project was a pitch from Wink, an optician software development company. The pitch was to create an application that could recommend products based on their customers.

This application is a fully functioning Ecommerce application that impliments AI and ML through Google Vision AI and TensorFlow Mediapipe to provide eyeglasses recommendations for the user.

The application is hosted in Heroku. This is built with the MERN stack and impliments a highly tested back end for the AI and ML routes.
